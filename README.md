## Introduciton:

This is my first React project. A [basic react template project](https://github.com/15Dkatz/react-bootcamp/tree/master/react-app-template) is modified to implement this project

It generates puzzles that are inspired by the Daily Mail's [30 Seccond Challenge](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-499509/Day-Two-brilliant-new-brain-trainer-30-Second-Challenge.html).


## Usage:

Users select a *difficulty level*, and a *timespan* (30s - or 45/60s with handicap), to begin the game.

The user must perform a series of calculations in a given time-frame, and arrive at the correct final answer.

## Design and Structure:

- Usage of React Components, Redux Global Store - with unidirectional dataflow (Actions and Reducers).

**App Structure:**
